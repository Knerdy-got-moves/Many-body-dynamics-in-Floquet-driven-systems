# Hilbert Space Fragmentation in Floquet-Driven Systems presentation

This folder contains the slides for the **Ninth-semester presentation** titled *“Hilbert space fragmentation in Floquet-driven systems”* by **Rishi Paresh Joshi**, under the guidance of **Dr. Tapan Mishra** at the National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER).

## Overview

The presentation provides an introduction to **out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics** and the **eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH)**, then discusses mechanisms that violate ETH, with a focus on **Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF)** in periodically driven (Floquet) many-body systems. It combines conceptual background with a concrete spin chain model to illustrate **Floquet prethermal fragmentation** and its signatures in entanglement and autocorrelations.

## Contents of the Slides

The slides are organized into the following main parts:

- Out-of-equilibrium dynamics: quenches, ramps, and general drives, including the Floquet formalism for periodic Hamiltonians.
- Eigenstate thermalization and Floquet heating: ETH in static and driven systems and conditions for infinite-temperature behavior.
- ETH-violating mechanisms: integrability, many-body localization, quantum scars, and **Hilbert space fragmentation** as strong ergodicity breaking.
- Static and driven HSF examples: dipole-conserving spin chains and a periodically driven fermionic chain showing prethermal fragmentation.
- Our model: a nonintegrable spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ Ising chain with longitudinal and transverse fields under a symmetric square-wave Floquet drive.
- Results and diagnostics: entanglement entropy growth, infinite-temperature autocorrelations, and structure of the first-order Floquet Hamiltonian $H_F^{(1)}$.


## Key Ideas Highlighted

- **Floquet systems**: Dynamics generated by a time-periodic Hamiltonian $H(t+T)=H(t)$ and encoded in the one-period Floquet unitary $U_F$.
- **Hilbert space fragmentation**: Splitting of a symmetry sector into exponentially many dynamically disconnected Krylov subspaces, leading to ETH only within fragments and persistent memory of initial conditions.
- **Prethermal fragmentation**: For suitable drive frequencies, the first-order Floquet Hamiltonian becomes nearly block-diagonal, causing constrained dynamics and slow or suppressed Floquet heating on long but finite timescales.


## How to Use This Material

- As a **conceptual introduction** to ETH, Floquet heating, and Hilbert space fragmentation for advanced undergraduate or graduate courses.
- As a **reference** when constructing or analyzing Floquet spin-chain models that exhibit constrained dynamics and nonthermal behavior.
- As supporting material for talks, seminars, or thesis work on **quantum many-body dynamics** and **ergodicity breaking**.
