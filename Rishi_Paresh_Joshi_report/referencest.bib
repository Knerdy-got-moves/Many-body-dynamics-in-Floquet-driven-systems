	abstract = {We investigate a one-dimensional correlated-hopping model of spinless fermions with an East constraint. We first analytically unravel the complete fragmentation structure of this model by labeling each fragment by a unique root configuration and utilizing the transfer matrix method. We show that the growth of the size of each fragment of the model follows the widely studied Dyck sequence and is therefore analytically tractable with the help of Catalan triangles. While the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) does not hold within the full Hilbert space which exhibits Poisson statistics of the energy level spacing, an examination of various quantities restricted to the largest fragments shows that a weaker version of the subspace-restricted thermalization holds. This weaker violation of the ETH within the largest fragments is supported by the presence of subspace-restricted quantum many-body scars due to quantum fragmentation. Our analysis further reveals that the filling fraction at which the model has the largest fragment shifts with increasing system sizes from half-filling due to the distinct fragmentation structure. Next, we show that the inclusion of a nearest-neighbor density-density interaction with strength 𝑉 induces a spectral transition within the largest fragment from a weakly ETH-violating phase containing scars to a statistical bubble localized phase as 𝑉 increases. In particular, the 𝑉→∞ limit produces an integrable model. We find that the addition of finite-𝑉 stabilizes the ground state near half-filling while keeping intact the fragmentation structure of the East model. However, this behavior abruptly changes exactly at 𝑉=∞ due to the emergence of a distinct fragmentation structure; we analytically explore this in a comprehensive manner. The infinite-𝑉 model has many interesting properties, among which the appearance of the ground state and the largest fragment at two different filling fractions is specially noteworthy. Finally, we propose an experimental setup to realize the infinite- model as a particular limit of a special kind of model with an on-site potential.},

The latter arises naturally from the confinement of domain walls. Remarkably, while some connected components of the Hilbert space thermalize, others are integrable by Bethe ansatz. We further demonstrate how this Hilbert-space fragmentation pattern arises perturbatively in the confining limit of ℤ2 gauge theory coupled to fermionic matter, leading to a hierarchy of timescales for motion of the fermions.

A crisp example of this phenomenon is provided by a “fractonic” model of quantum dynamics constrained to conserve both charge and dipole moment. We show how the Hilbert space of the fractonic model dynamically fractures into disconnected emergent subsectors within a particular charge and dipole symmetry sector. This shattering can occur in arbitrary spatial dimensions. A large number of the emergent subsectors, exponentially many in system volume, have dimension one and exhibit strictly localized quantum dynamics—even in the absence of spatial disorder and in the presence of temporal noise. Other emergent subsectors display nontrivial dynamics and may be constructed by embedding finite-sized nontrivial blocks into the localized subspace. While “fractonic” models provide a particularly clean realization, the shattering phenomenon is more general, as we discuss. We also discuss how the key phenomena may be readily observed in near term ultracold atom experiments. In experimental realizations, the conservation laws are approximate rather than exact, so the localization only survives up to a prethermal timescale that we estimate. We comment on the implications of these results for recent predictions of Bloch/Stark many-body localization.},

	abstract = {Recent realization of a kinetically constrained chain of Rydberg atoms by Bernien et al., [Nature (London) 551, 579 (2017)] resulted in the observation of unusual revivals in the many-body quantum dynamics. In our previous work [C. J. Turner et al., Nat. Phys. 14, 745 (2018)], such dynamics was attributed to the existence of “quantum scarred” eigenstates in the many-body spectrum of the experimentally realized model. Here, we present a detailed study of the eigenstate properties of the same model. We find that the majority of the eigenstates exhibit anomalous thermalization: the observable expectation values converge to their Gibbs ensemble values, but parametrically slower compared to the predictions of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). Amidst the thermalizing spectrum, we identify nonergodic eigenstates that strongly violate the ETH, whose number grows polynomially with system size. Previously, the same eigenstates were identified via large overlaps with certain product states, and were used to explain the revivals observed in experiment. Here, we find that these eigenstates, in addition to highly atypical expectation values of local observables, also exhibit subthermal entanglement entropy that scales logarithmically with the system size. Moreover, we identify an additional class of quantum scarred eigenstates, and discuss their manifestations in the dynamics starting from initial product states. We use forward scattering approximation to describe the structure and physical properties of quantum scarred eigenstates. Finally, we discuss the stability of quantum scars to various perturbations. We observe that quantum scars remain robust when the introduced perturbation is compatible with the forward scattering approximation. In contrast, the perturbations which most efficiently destroy quantum scars also lead to the restoration of “canonical” thermalization.},

We provide a brief introduction to quantum thermalization, paying particular attention to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) and the resulting single-eigenstate statistical mechanics. We then focus on a class of systems that fail to quantum thermalize and whose eigenstates violate the ETH: These are the many-body Anderson-localized systems; their long-time properties are not captured by the conventional ensembles of quantum statistical mechanics. These systems can forever locally remember information about their local initial conditions and are thus of interest for possibilities of storing quantum information. We discuss key features of many-body localization (MBL) and review a phenomenology of the MBL phase. Single-eigenstate statistical mechanics within the MBL phase reveal dynamically stable ordered phases, and phase transitions among them, that are invisible to equilibrium statistical mechanics and can occur at high energy and low spatial dimensionality, where equilibrium ordering is forbidden.},

	abstract = {This review gives a pedagogical introduction to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), its basis, and its implications to statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. In the first part, ETH is introduced as a natural extension of ideas from quantum chaos and random matrix theory (RMT). To this end, we present a brief overview of classical and quantum chaos, as well as RMT and some of its most important predictions. The latter include the statistics of energy levels, eigenstate components, and matrix elements of observables. Building on these, we introduce the ETH and show that it allows one to describe thermalization in isolated chaotic systems without invoking the notion of an external bath. We examine numerical evidence of eigenstate thermalization from studies of many-body lattice systems. We also introduce the concept of a quench as a means of taking isolated systems out of equilibrium, and discuss results of numerical experiments on quantum quenches. The second part of the review explores the implications of quantum chaos and ETH to thermodynamics. Basic thermodynamic relations are derived, including the second law of thermodynamics, the fundamental thermodynamic relation, fluctuation theorems, the fluctuation–dissipation relation, and the Einstein and Onsager relations. In particular, it is shown that quantum chaos allows one to prove these relations for individual Hamiltonian eigenstates and thus extend them to arbitrary stationary statistical ensembles. In some cases, it is possible to extend their regimes of applicability beyond the standard thermal equilibrium domain. We then show how one can use these relations to obtain nontrivial universal energy distributions in continuously driven systems. At the end of the review, we briefly discuss the relaxation dynamics and description after relaxation of integrable quantum systems, for which ETH is violated. We present results from numerical experiments and analytical studies of quantum quenches at integrability. We introduce the concept of the generalized Gibbs ensemble and discuss its connection with ideas of prethermalization in weakly interacting systems.},

	abstract = {A closed quantum-mechanical system with a large number of degrees of freedom does not necessarily give time averages in agreement with the microcanonical distribution. For systems where the different degrees of freedom are uncoupled, situations are discussed that show a violation of the usual statistical-mechanical rules. By adding a finite but very small perturbation in the form of a random matrix, it is shown that the results of quantum statistical mechanics are recovered. Expectation values in energy eigenstates for this perturbed system are also discussed, and deviations from the microcanonical result are shown to become exponentially small in the number of degrees of freedom.},
